### Why NestJS?

- Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify) but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer.
- This allows developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules that are available for the underlying platform.

### Why Mongoose?

- MongooseJS provides an abstraction layer on top of MongoDB that eliminates the need to use named collections.
- Models in Mongoose perform the bulk of the work of establishing up default values for document properties and validating data.
- Functions may be attached to Models in MongooseJS. This allows for seamless incorporation of new functionality.
- Queries use function chaining rather than embedded mnemonics which result in code that is more flexible and readable, therefore more maintainable as well.
